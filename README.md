# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project explores an HR dataset to uncover patterns in employee attrition. The goal was to identify which factors—such as job satisfaction, department, and tenure—most strongly correlate with turnover.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- HR analytics dataset

## Key Highlights
- Visualized attrition by department, satisfaction level, and age
- Identified trends in voluntary vs. involuntary turnover
- Suggested areas where HR could intervene to retain staff
